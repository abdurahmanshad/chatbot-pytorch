## Introduction

The chatbot is built using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, and leverages natural language processing techniques to understand user queries and generate appropriate responses. It utilizes a deep learning model trained on a dataset of conversations to learn patterns and generate contextually relevant replies.

## Features

- Engages in natural language conversations with users
- Provides contextually relevant responses
- Easy to integrate with existing projects

## Installation

To install and run the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

If the first run fails, you may need to download the required NLTK data by running the following Python code:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

## Usage

To use the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have completed the installation steps mentioned above.
2. Run the training script to create the `data.pth` file by executing the following command:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```
   This will train the chatbot model using the provided dataset and save the trained model as `data.pth`.

3. After the training is complete, you can run the chatbot by executing the following command:
   ```
   python chat.py
   ```
   The chatbot will start and prompt you for input. Enter your queries or messages, and the chatbot will respond accordingly.
